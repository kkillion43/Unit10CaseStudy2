# Unit10CaseStudy2

## Introduction

The prime minister of Chulwalhar has asked us to help him in forecasting exports from his country. In order to do this we have been given as-is data, which is the original or observed data, and planned data, which is what Chulwalhar would like to export. We also have a list of indicators that may affect exports. Our job is to find out the best way to forecast Chulwalharâ€™s exports in 2014 based on data collected before this year. In other words, we want to create a credible statistical model.

The export data for Chulwalhar are in two CSV files. One contains the as-is data and the other one contains the planned data. These data sets are also composed of other data sets: monthly and yearly for both groups. Your task is to take all of these data sets, import them into R, and develop a model to forecast the exports of these particular products for the prime minister of Chulwalhar.
